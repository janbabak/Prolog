# Logical programming in Prolog

## üìù Description

This repository contains programs developed during the Programming Paradigms course at the Faculty of Information Technology Czech Technical University.

## ü§ì Logical Programming

Logical programming is an approach to programming based on formal logic. Programs consist of statements and rules expressing facts and relationships about a problem domain.

Programmers define relationships between entities and constraints on possible solutions. The system searches for valid solutions by applying inference rules. Prolog is a popular language in this paradigm, which allows for expressing complex relationships and constraints concisely. Logical programming is well-suited for tasks involving symbolic reasoning, knowledge representation, and manipulation of complex data structures.

## üóÉÔ∏è Content
The repository contains the following files:
- `binarySearchTree.pl` operations with binary search trees (insert, contains, delete, create tree from list)
- `factorial.pl` mathematical factorial
- `fibonacci.pl` computes the $n$-th Fibonacci number
- `lists.pl` operations with lists (contains, get $n$-th element, length, push back, delete first, delete all, replace all, get last element, flatten, reverse, powerset)
- `mergeSort.pl` standard sorting algorithm
- `occurrenceCounter.pl` counts all occurrences in a list
- `selectSort.pl` another sorting algorithm
- `unarySystem.pl` arithmetic operations over the unary system, where numbers are represented like this: `0 = [], 1 = [x], 2 = [x, x], ...` 

## üë®‚Äçüéì Takeaways

Throughout this course, I gained knowledge about programming paradigms beyond the imperative approach, including logical and functional. It came to my attention that certain tasks can be accomplished more efficiently with alternative methods. Additionally, I enhanced my understanding of recursion and acquired knowledge of recursive algorithms like merge sort and operations involving binary trees.
